Fantasy Football Prediction - the road to victory!
========================================================

This is part of a project that I'm working on to construct a model to determine which player to use for any given week based off of a set of predictors.

I analyzed three predictors when determining the performance and the ultimate point performance of my current player, Cam Newton.

- Opposing team defensive rank
- Location of game
- Team Played

I used defensive rank for this excercise as it has been the best predictor thus far and is one i would like to share with you
