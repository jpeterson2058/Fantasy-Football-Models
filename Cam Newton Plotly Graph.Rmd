This is part of a project that I'm working on to construct a model to determine which player to use for any given week based off of a set of predictors.

The following graph plots defensive rank vs. passing yards for Cam Newton from 2011 to current.  I used defensive rank for this excercise as it has been the best predictor thus far.

QB Analysis - Pull Player Data
```{r QB, echo=FALSE}
CN<- read.csv("Cam Newton.csv")
CNdf<- as.data.frame(CN)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)

plot_ly(CNdf, x= ~Def.Rank.Yds,y= ~PassYds, text = ~paste("Passing Yards: ", PassYds, "Defense Rank:", Def.Rank.Yds), color = ~Def.Rank.Yds, size = ~Def.Rank.Yds
)
```
