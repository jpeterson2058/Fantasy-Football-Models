## Fantasy Football Prediciton - the road to victory!

This is part of a project that I'm working on to construct a model to determine which player to use for any given week based off of a set of predictors.

I analyzed three predictors when determining the performance and the ultimate point performance of my current player, Cam Newton.

- Opposing team defensive rank
- Location of game
- Team Played

## Data

```{r, comment=""}
CN<- read.csv("Cam Newton.csv")
CNdf<- as.data.frame(CN)
summary(CNdf)
```

## Passing Yards vs. Defense Rank

```{r, comment= "", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
plot1<- qplot(Def.Rank.Yds,PassYds, data = CNdf) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
(gg<- ggplotly(plot1))
```
